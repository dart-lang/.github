# Dart

## A client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform

Dart is:

  * **Optimized for UI**: Develop with a programming language specialized     
    around the needs of user interface creation.

  * **Productive**: Make changes iteratively: use hot reload to see the result
    instantly in your running app.
  
  * **Fast on all platforms**: Compile to ARM & x64 machine code for mobile,
    desktop, and backend. Or compile to JavaScript for the web.

Dart's flexible compiler technology lets you run Dart code in different ways,
depending on your target platform and goals:

  * **Dart Native**: For programs targeting devices (mobile, desktop, server,
    and more), Dart Native includes both a Dart VM with JIT (just-in-time)
    compilation and an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for producing machine
    code.
  
  * **Dart Web**: For programs targeting the web, Dart Web includes both a
    development time compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler
    (dart2js).
